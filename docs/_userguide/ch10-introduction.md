NVList is a tool for creating visual novels.

## Supported platforms
NVList projects can be exported to run on the following platforms:
- Windows
- Mac OS X
- Linux
- Android
- iOS (experimental)

_TODO Add screenshots for every supported platform._

## Scripting 
Since visual novels consist mostly of text, the scripting language used by NVList was designed to make displaying text as convenient as possible. Take for example the following code:
{% include sourcecode.html content="
This is some example text.
" %}

The above is actually valid NVList script to show "This is some example text." on the screen. For a full introduction to scripting, please refer to [Script Introduction]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _userguide/ch20-script-intro.md %}).

_TODO Add a screenshot of what it looks like._
